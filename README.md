This repository covers all classwork from my Geospatial Programming class and the Final project for the class. The final project consists of testing if a polling location being in a religious building influences voting results.
I am a Masters student in Political Science at the University of Iowa. I am interesting in the relationship between religion and politics and how different political and religious organizations affect each other.
